            "      Hello,  I have upper abdominal pain that radiates to my back, eventually I start having severe gagging & vomit.  After the retching/gagging subsides, the pain subsides.  I have had my gall bladder removed several years ago.  Had an upper endoscopy in Feb. 2013,  had double hernia repair with mesh 3/20/13.  thought that was causing this pain but i started having it again about 2 weeks ago.  I have had this for over 2 years & there is a pattern that it comes and goes.  Any Ideas? Hi welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  Thanks for calling Chat Doctor. Forum.  You have upper abdominal pain, radiates to back, have gagging and vomit then pain subsided. Endoscopy done double hernia found and repaired with mesh, pain recurred 2 weeks back the pain comes and goes. Gall bladder removed several years ago.  It appears that the pain is due to gastric irritation due to irritant foods, like spicy foods, junk foods, and oily foods, and some foods which your stomach is allergic like milk and milk products.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery.  Best regards.\n",
